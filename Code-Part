This is all about using python code to tweet messages over twitter . I chose the social media twitter because it is a fantastic 
source to work with data . You can use it to get real-time news. You can use it for pretty much anything you can imagine, just as 
long as you can get access to its data. And you can get access to its data through its API. To interact with the Twitter APIs 
we’ll be using the Twython library. So, what actually an API is ? It is  a set of functions and procedures allowing the creation
of applications that access the features or data. In order to use Twitter’s APIs, you need to get some credentials. SO , you needed
an twitter account as an pre-requisite for this work . 
Next what you have to do is . Getting the access tokens . There are 2 types of tokens actually . The consumer key and consumer secret
tell Twitter what application is accessing its APIs, while the access token and access token secret tell Twitter who is accessing its 
APIs. If you have ever used your Twitter account to log in to some other site, the “click to authorize” page was generating an access 
token for that site to use to convince Twitter that it was you. To get this access token  you must create an app in twitter where
basically you have to provide the details of Name of the project with description and URL. This will provide you consumer key and
access token . Upon clicking create access token you will be provided with Consumer secret and access token secret.Then coding part
has to be done using python in which tweepy module should be included . OAuth is an open-standard authorization protocol or framework
that provides applications the ability for “secure designated access.” For example, you can tell Facebook that it’s OK for ESPN.com
to access your profile or post updates to your timeline without having to give ESPN your Facebook password. This minimizes risk in a 
major way: In the event ESPN suffers a breach, your Facebook password remains safe. 
OAuth doesn’t share password data but instead uses authorization tokens to prove an identity between consumers and service providers.
OAuth is an authentication protocol that allows you to approve one application interacting with another on your behalf without giving
away your password.
 # importing the module 
import tweepy 
  
# personal details 
consumer_key ="xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx"
consumer_secret ="xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx"
access_token ="xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx"
access_token_secret ="xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx"
  
# authentication of consumer key and secret 
auth = tweepy.OAuthHandler(consumer_key, consumer_secret) 
  
# authentication of access token and secret 
auth.set_access_token(access_token, access_token_secret) 
api = tweepy.API(auth) 
  
# update the status 
api.update_status(status ="Hello Everyone !") 

image_path ="path of the image" # toDo 
  
# to attach the media file 
status = api.update_with_media(image_path, tweet)  
api.update_status(status = tweet)
